	9.  The input to this problem consists of an ordered list of $n$ words. The length of the $i$th word is $w_{i}$, that
			is the ith word takes up $w_{i}$ spaces.  (For simplicity assume that there are no spaces between words.)
			The goal is to break this ordered list of words into lines, this is called a layout. Note that you can not
			reorder the words.  The length of a line is the sum of the lengths of the words on that line. The ideal
			line length is $L$. No line may be longer than $L$, although it may be shorter.  The penalty for having a
			line of length $K$ is $L - K$. \textit{The total penalty is the \textbf{sum} of the line penalties}. The problem is to find a
			layout that minimizes the total penalty.\\
			Prove of disprove that the following greedy algorithm correctly solves this problem.
			
			\begin{verbatim}
			For i= 1 to n
			     Place the ith word on the current line if it fits
			      else place the ith word on a new line
			\end{verbatim}

	13. Consider the following problem.\\
			INPUT: Positive integers $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ and $c_{1}, \ldots , c_{n}$.\\
			OUTPUT: An $n$ by $n$ matrix $A$ with 0/1 entries such that for all $i$ the sum of the $i$th row in $A$ is $r_{i}$
			and the sum of the $i$th column in $A$ is $c_{i}$, if such a matrix exists.\\
			Think of the problem this way.  You want to put pawns on an $n$ by $n$ chessboard so that the $i$th row
			has $r_{i}$ pawns and the $i$th column has $c_{i}$ pawns.\\
			Consider the following greedy algorithm that constructs $A$ row by row.  Assume that the first $i - 1$
			rows have been constructed. Let a $j$ be the number of 1’s in the $j$th column in the first $i - 1$ rows. Now
			the $r_{i}$ columns with with maximum $c_{j} - a_{j}$ are assigned 1’s in row $i$, and the rest of the columns are
			assigned 0’s. That is, the columns that still needs the most 1’s are given 1’s. Formally prove that this
			algorithm is correct.\\
