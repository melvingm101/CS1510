	11.  Show that the Vertex Cover Problem is self-reducible. The decision problem is to take a graph $G$ and
an integer $k$ and decide if $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$ or not.  The optimization problem takes a
graph $G$, and returns a smallest vertex cover in $G$.  So you must show that if the decision problem
has a polynomial time algorithm then the optimization problem also has a polynomial time algorithm.
Recall that a vertex cover is a collection $S$ of vertices with the property that every edge is incident to
a vertex in $S$.

	14.  Consider the problem where the input is a collection of linear inequalities.  For example, the input
might look like $3x-2y = 3$ and $2x-3x = 9$. The problem is to determine if there is an integer solution
that simultaneously satisfies all the inequalities. Show that this problem is NP-hard using the fact that
it is NP-hard to determine if a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable.

	16.  The input to the three coloring problem is a graph $G$, and the problem is to decide whether the vertices
of $G$ can be colored with three colors such that no pair of adjacent vertices are colored the same color.
The input to the four coloring problem is a graph $G$, and the problem is to decide whether the vertices
of $G$ can be colored with four colors such that no pair of adjacent vertices are colored the same color.
Show by reduction that if the four coloring problem has a polynomial time algorithm then so does the
three coloring problem.
