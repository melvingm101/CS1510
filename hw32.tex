22. Give a parallel algorithm for the following problem that runs in time O(log $n$) on an EREW PRAM.
The input is a binary tree with $n$ nodes. Assume that each processor has a pointer to a unique node
in the tree. The problem is determine the balance factor of each node in the tree. The balance factor
of a node is the height of its left subtree minus the height of its right subtree.
\\

24. Design a parallel algorithm that takes a binary expression tree, where the leaves are Boolean values
0 or 1, and the internal nodes are the three standard logical operations: NOT, OR, and AND. The
output should be the value of the expression represented by the tree. Your algorithm should run in
O(log $n$) time on a CREW PRAM with $n$ processors, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. You
may assume that each processor initially has a pointer to a unique node in the tree.
