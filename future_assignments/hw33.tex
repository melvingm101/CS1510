Extra Credit 25. Give a parallel algorithms for the following problem that runs in time O(log n) on an EREW PRAM
with n processors. The input is a fully paranthesized arithmetic expression, with n symbols, stored in
an n element array in the standard in-order fasion. The output should be an expression tree with each
processor having a pointer to a unique node in the tree.
NO HINT: This is the one problem assigned this term that I don't know how to do. This was from an
old text that we used to use. I seem to recall that the text said the problem was easy, but I worked on
it for at least 15 minutes and couldn't solve it, so decided to assign it as homework several years ago.
No one has solved it yet
