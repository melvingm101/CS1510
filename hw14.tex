	18.	The input to this problem is a set of $n$ gems. Each gem has a value in dollars and is either a ruby or
			an emerald. Let the sum of the values of the gems be $L$. The problem is to determine if it is possible
			to partition of the gems into two parts $P$ and $Q$, such that each part has the same value, the number
			of rubies in $P$ is equal to the number of rubies in $Q$, and the number of emeralds in $P$ is equal to the
			number of emeralds in $Q$. Note that a partition means that every gem must be in exactly one of $P$ or
			$Q$. You algorithm should run in time polynomial in $n + L$.\\

	19.	The input to this problem consists of an ordered list of $n$ words. The length of the $i$th word is $w_i$, that
			is the $i$th word takes up $w_i$ spaces.  (For simplicity assume that there are no spaces between words.)
			The goal is to break this ordered list of words into lines, this is called a layout. Note that you can not
			reorder the words.  The length of a line is the sum of the lengths of the words on that line. The ideal
			line length is $L$. No line may be longer than $L$, although it may be shorter.  The penalty for having a
			line of length $K$ is $L - K$. \textit{The total penalty is the} \textbf{maximum} \textit{of the line penalties}. The problem is to
			find a layout that minimizes the total penalty. Give a polynomial time algorithm for this problem.
