	27.	Give a polynomial time algorithm for the following problem. The input consists of two dimensional
array $R$ of non-negative integers, and an integer $k$. The value $R_{t,p}$ gives the number of of users
requesting page $p$ at time $t$ ( say from a www server. At each integer time, the server can broadcast
either 0 or 1 pages. If the server broadcasts page $p$ at time $t$, the the requests of all the users who
requested page $p$ strictly before time $t$ are satisfied. The server can make at most $k$ broadcasts. The
goal is to pick the $k$ times to broadcast, and the pages to broadcast at those $k$ times, in order to
minimize the total time (over all requests) that requests/users have to wait in order to have their
requests satisfied. So problem 24 is a special case of this problem where there is only one page.\\

	3. Show that if there is an $O(n^k)$, $k \geq 1$, time algorithm for squaring a degree $n$ polynomial,
then there is an $O(n^k)$ time algorithm for multiplying two degree $n$ polynomials. Assume that the polynomials
are given by their coecients.
\newpage
	4. Consider the following variant of the minimum Steiner tree problem. The input is $n$ points in the plane.
Each point is given by its Cartesian coordinates. The problem is build a collection of roads between
these points so that you can reach any city from any other city and the total length of the roads is
minimized. The collection of roads should be output as an adjacency list structure, that is, for each
point $p$ of intersection of roads there are a list of roads that meet that point. Roads must terminate
when they meet one of the original input points, or when they meet another road. For example, if the
points are (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (2, 2) the output would be:
From the point (0, 0) there are roads to the points (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1,-1), and (-1,-1). From the point
(1, 1) there are roads to (0, 0) and (2, 2). From the point (-1, 1) there is a road to (0, 0). From the
point (1,-1) there is a road to (0, 0). From the point (-1,-1) there is a road to (0, 0).
Roads from (1, 1) to (-1,-1), and from (1,-1) to (-1, 1) would not be allowed because they cross. A
road from (-1,-1) to (2, 2) would not be allowed since it would cross the point (1, 1).
Show by reduction that if you can solve this problem in linear time, then you can sort n numbers in
linear time.

	22. The input to this problem is $n$ points $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ on a line. A good path $P$ has the property that one
endpoint of $P$ is the origin and every $x_i$ is covered by $P$. Note that $P$ need not be simple, that is, it
can backtrack over territory that it has already covered. Assume a vehicle moves along this path from
the origin at unit speed. The response time $r_i$ for each $x_i$ is the time until the vehicle first reaches
$x_i$. The problem is to find the good path that minimizes $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{r_1}{n}$, the average response time. For
example, if the points are $x_1 = 1$ $x_2 = 8$ and $x_3 = -2$ and the path visited the points in the order
$x_1, x_3, x_2$, the average response time for this path would be 1/3 + (1 + 3)/3 + (1 + 3 + 10)/3. Give a
polynomial time algorithm for this problem.
