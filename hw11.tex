	10.	The input for this problem consists of $n$ keys $K_1, \ldots, K_n$, with $K_1 < K_2 < \ldots , K_n$, and associated
			probabilities $p_1, \ldots, p_n$. The problem is to find the AVL tree for these keys that minimizes the expected
			depth of a key.  An AVL tree is a binary search tree with the property that every node has balance
			factor -1, 0, or 1. Give a polynomial time algorithm for this problem.\\

	11.	The input consists of $n$ intervals over the real line. The output should be a collection $C$  of nonoverlapping 
			intervals such the sum of the lengths of the intervals in $C$ is maximized. Give a polynomial
			time algorithm for this problem.\\
